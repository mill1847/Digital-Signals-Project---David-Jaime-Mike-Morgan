# Digital-Signals-Project---David-Jaime-Mike-Morgan

Hey guys, here's our github page. This is a file sharing tool used by programmers that's super handy. 

So I'll post the recordings we made (11/11/2016) so we all can play with them.

Remember whenever you post to write comments (more is always better than less) and there's not a reason to override anything so just leave in old stuff as we may need it later. 

Look below my signature for the schedule of dates (as always feel free to change any mistakes I made). I put it together from memory so my dates may be off. 

Ask if you need any assistance!

Thanks guys, see ya soon!

David
